# FINITUDE

*Creative constraints for songwriting*

## When everything is possible, it's hard to begin.

Modernity is walking us in empty circles. This is one way out. 

**Finitude** uses chance and constraint to open new paths for songwriting. Click the dice to reveal one of six options. Each of the seven steps adds a fresh creative boundary—theme, story, imagery, structure, or sound. By the end, you'll have a unique framework to write from.

You get one veto per session to swap out any result, but otherwise the roll stands.

**Embrace your limits. That's where the songs live.**

## How It Works

1. **Focus your intention** - Begin with a 5-second breathing ritual that seeds your session
2. **Roll the dice** - Each step presents 6 AI-generated options
3. **Accept the constraint** - What you roll is what you get (with one veto allowed)
4. **Build your framework** - Seven steps create your complete songwriting blueprint

### The Seven Steps

1. **Theme** - Core emotional territory (brief poetic fragments)
2. **Symbol Pair** - Two resonant images joined by "+"
3. **Mechanic** - Musical DNA to borrow (rhythm, harmony, texture)
4. **Form** - Song structure notation
5. **Color Mood** - Emotional palette with context
6. **Harmony** - Chord progressions or harmonic approaches  
7. **Production Move** - Specific production technique

## About

Created for the A.G. Cook-instructed [School of Song](https://schoolofsong.org/) course.

Finitude is a response to the paralysis of infinite creative possibilities. By accepting randomness and working within constraints, we find freedom through limitation.

## Technical Details

- Single HTML file application
- Local-first data persistence with Fireproof
- True random number generation via Random.org
- AI-powered option generation with temperature-based creativity levels
- Neobrutalism design aesthetic

## True Randomness & Intentionality

Finitude uses **true random numbers** from Random.org, which generates randomness from atmospheric noise—not algorithmic pseudo-randomness. This matters for two reasons:

1. **No patterns, no predictions** - Computer-generated "random" numbers follow hidden patterns. True randomness breaks these cycles, creating genuine surprise.

2. **Space for intention** - True randomness creates a blank canvas for psychic input. When you focus your intention during the breathing ritual, you're not fighting against predetermined patterns. The quantum uncertainty in atmospheric noise leaves room for consciousness to influence outcomes—whether you believe in synchronicity, manifestation, or simply the power of focused attention.

The 5-second intention ritual before each roll isn't just meditation—it's an opportunity to project your creative needs into genuinely open probability space. The dice become a bridge between your intention and the universe's response.

Some call it magic. Some call it quantum consciousness. We just call it songwriting.

## Philosophy

In an era of endless options and perpetual scrolling, creative constraints become acts of resistance. Finitude doesn't expand your possibilities—it collapses them into something real. A song. A beginning. A way forward.

The dice don't care about your preferences. The constraints don't bend to your comfort. And that's precisely where the magic lives—in the space between what you wanted and what you got.
